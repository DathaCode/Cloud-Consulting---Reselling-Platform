# Getting Started with Atlassian Cloud Migration

Migrating from Atlassian Server to Cloud can seem daunting, but with the right approach, you can ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to your teams.

## Why Migrate to Atlassian Cloud?

Atlassian Cloud offers several advantages over Server:

- **Automatic Updates**: Always access the latest features without manual upgrades
- **Scalability**: Easily scale up or down based on your team size
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security maintained by Atlassian
- **Cost Efficiency**: Predictable subscription pricing eliminates infrastructure costs

## Pre-Migration Planning

Before starting your migration, consider these critical steps:

###  1. Assess Your Current Environment

- Document all plugins and customizations
- Identify dependencies and integrations
- Review user permissions and workflows
- Catalog all projects and their configurations

### 2. Choose Migration Method

Atlassian provides two main migration paths:

- **Cloud Migration Assistant**: Best for straightforward migrations
- **Manual Migration**: Required for complex customizations

### 3. Create a Timeline

A realistic migration timeline includes:

1. **Planning Phase** (2-4 weeks): Assessment and preparation
2. **Testing Phase** (1-2 weeks): Pilot migration with test data
3. **Execution Phase** (1-2 days): Production migration
4. **Validation Phase** (1 week): Testing and user training

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Plugin Compatibility

Not all Server plugins have Cloud equivalents. Research alternatives early in the planning phase.

### Data Volume

Large attachments and extensive histories can slow migration. Consider archiving old data before migrating.

### User Training

Don't underestimate the importance of user training. Cloud interfaces differ from Server in subtle but important ways.
