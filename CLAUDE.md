# VIN Cloud Solutions — company website

Marketing site for **VIN Cloud Solutions** (Ragama, Sri Lanka): AI solutions & integrations, web/mobile development,
cloud consulting (AWS, Azure, Google, Microsoft 365, Oracle, Atlassian), data migration and managed cloud.
Live domain: **https://cloud.vinsolutions.lk**. Single-page React app with a markdown blog.

## Working rules (from the owner)
- **Never commit, push or create branches.** The owner commits everything. Leave changes in the working tree.
- Ask before anything outward-facing (real form submissions, deploys, publishing).
- **Hosting = AWS Amplify connected to GitHub** (`DathaCode/Cloud-Consulting---Reselling-Platform`, branch `main`). Amplify builds from
  `amplify.yml`; there are **no GitHub Actions** — don't add workflows. Pushing to `main` may publish the site (if auto build is on),
  so never push; the owner does.
- **Never name clients** in case studies or copy (no "Hiru News" or any other client). Describe by sector only.
- **No em dashes (—) anywhere in website copy** (src/, index.html, public/). Use commas, colons, periods or parentheses.
- **Never publish prices or budgets.** Pricing is quoted in LKR after requirement analysis — say that, nothing more.
- Case-study figures for the 4 non-featured engagements are representative values approved by the owner; the 2 featured
  AI products (Sinhala AI Proofreader, Graphic-Cast) are real in-house work.
- Keep the look: slightly dark, techy, brand teal from the logo. Verify UI changes visually (skill `ui-verification`).

## Stack
React 19 · Vite 6 · Tailwind CSS 3 · framer-motion 12 · three.js + @react-three/fiber 9 + drei 10 · react-router 7 ·
lucide-react · react-markdown + gray-matter (blog). Plain **JavaScript/JSX** (no TypeScript). Node ≥ 20 required.
No test runner is configured; `npm run build` + visual checks are the gate.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run build     # must pass before calling work done
npm run preview   # serve dist/ on :4173 (use for screenshots)
```

## Lessons learned (append new ones here — this is the project memory)
- `react-helmet-async` is incompatible with React 19 and blocked installs; it was removed. Use `useSeo()`.
- drei `<Html>` mounted in a canvas's first commit can silently not render (intermittently) → every scene gates labels with `useLabelsReady()` from `three/utils.js`.
- `instancedMesh` colors must be set before first render or the shader compiles without instance colors.
- OrbitControls sets `touch-action: none` → never mount it on coarse pointers (blocks page scroll on phones).
- Forcing `three` into a `manualChunks` chunk pulled Vite's preload helper into it → three got eagerly preloaded. Let lazy imports split it.
- Markdown from Windows checkouts has `\r\n`; regexes must not rely on `.+\n`.
- Very tall headless screenshots (> ~8000px) repeat content — screenshot per section instead.
- Python heredocs in Git Bash break on curly quotes (’) — write the script to a file in the scratchpad and run it.
- On Windows, a shell whose cwd is inside `dist/` makes `vite build` fail with `emptyDir` — cd out first.
- A clean-copy build (`npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline && npm run build`, as in `amplify.yml`) was verified 2026-10-05 — re-run it after dependency changes.
- The CSP in `customHttp.yml` was verified locally (3D, blog deep links, form) — any new third-party domain must be added to it.
- react-markdown runs without remark-gfm: blog tables/strikethrough don't render.
